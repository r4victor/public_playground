    Removes edges form the connected graph
    until the graph becomes a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

        :param graph: an adjacency list, each element is a tuple (node, cost)
        :return: returns `None`, modifies the graph

    At each iteration it first finds a cycle.
    Then breaks the cycle by removing the heaviest edge.
    When no more cycles exist, the graps is an MST.

    The algorithm is correct because if an edge is the heaviest edge of some cycle,
    it cannot be in an MST.
    Otherwise we could built an ST with the smaller weight by replacing this edge
    with another edge from the cycle.
    More thorough proof can be conducted using the induction.

    r (number of edges to remove) = m - (n - 1) = m - n + 1
    If the graph is a near tree (m <= n + 8), r <= 9.
    The maximum number of iteration is r.
    In this particular implementation:
        - cost of find_cycle <= 2m
        - cost of break_cycle <= 3m
    Cost of near_tree_mst <= r*5m <= 45m.
    Thus, near_tree_mst is O(m) = O(n).

    Another possible implementation is not to modify the graph
    but to keep track of removed edges and then built the MST in the end.
    It's more efficient and pure, but requires more bookkeeping.
    Its cost <= r*3m + 9m <= 36m.
